> "The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard." -- John Tukey

I am currently an associate professor at the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/people/faculty/YangChen.html) at the University of Michigan 
and a research associate professor at Michigan Institute for Data Science ([MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu/)).


Besides, I hold *"two full-time jobs"* as a mother of two.

> For me, being a mother made me a better professional, because coming home every night to my girls reminded me what I was working for. And being a professional made me a better mother, because by pursuing my dreams, I was modeling for my girls how to pursue their dreams. -- Michelle Obama


### Education

* Ph. D. in Statistics, Harvard University, May 2017.
