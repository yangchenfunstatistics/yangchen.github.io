> "The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyoneâ€™s backyard." --John Tukey

I am currently an assistant professor at the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the University of Michigan 
and a research assistant professor at Michigan Institute for Data Science ([MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu/)).
For more information, see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCgR0IXTiUxZ4dGgNoYN0F93fmaYlay2/view).

My research interests are statistical methodology and computational algorithms motivated by scientific applications. In particular, my past and ongoing projects are focused on the following topics:

* Bayesian modeling and computation
* Hidden Markov models and general finite mixture models
* Applied statistics and machine learning in astronomy and space science
* Statistical methods for large-scale imaging data
* Spatial-temporal data analysis
* Uncertainty quantification for complex models

### Education

* Ph. D. in Statistics, Harvard University, May 2017.
* B. Sc. in Mathematics, University of Science and Technology of China, July 2011.
